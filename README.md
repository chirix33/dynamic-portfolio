## **Project Overview**

This portfolio website is designed to provide an overview of my work and experience as a software engineer. It includes several sections:
1. **Bio Section**: A brief introduction about me.
2. **Experience Section**: A detailed breakdown of my work experience.
3. **Projects Section**: A searchable table showcasing the projects I’ve worked on, complete with tech stack details and live links.
4. **Contact Section**: Information for contacting me, including a link to my resume and social media.

The website has been designed with a focus on performance, accessibility, and responsiveness across different devices.

- **Smooth Scrolling & Active Link Detection**: Provides a smooth navigation experience with scroll-based active link highlighting.
- **Parallax Backgrounds**: Beautiful, dynamically loaded parallax images provide visual appeal.
- **Projects Search**: A search feature that allows filtering projects by name and tech stack.
- **Downloadable Resume**: Visitors can download my resume directly from the website.
- **Lazy Loading**: Images are lazy-loaded to improve performance.

## **Tech Stack**

This portfolio is built using the following technologies:

- **HTML5**: For semantic structure and content.
- **CSS3**: For custom styling and animations.
  - TailwindCSS for responsive design and utility-based styling.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: For interactivity and dynamic content loading.
- **Fetch API**: Used for fetching external data (e.g., projects, experience) from JSON files.
- **Unsplash API**: For dynamically loading background images.
- **IntersectionObserver API**: To handle lazy loading of parallax images and sections.
- **Local Storage**: Used to persist the user’s theme preference (light/dark).
- **FontAwesome & Custom SVGs**: For icons used throughout the website.
- **Google Fonts**: For custom fonts to enhance the website's look and feel.

## **Installation**

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps:

### **1. Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ashraf-portfolio.git
cd ashraf-portfolio
```

### **2. Install the dependencies**
Although this project doesn't rely on any backend technologies, you may want to set up a simple HTTP server for testing locally. You can use **http-server** for this.

```bash
npm install http-server -g
```

### **3. Start the local server**
```bash
http-server
```
Your local version of the website should now be available at `http://localhost:8080` by default.

## **Usage**

Once the website is running, you can explore the following sections:

1. **Bio Section**: Learn more about me.
2. **Experience Section**: View my past professional experience in the tech industry.
3. **Projects Section**: Explore my projects, filter them by tech stack, and visit live project demos.
4. **Resume & Contact**: Download my resume or reach out to me via LinkedIn or GitHub.

## **Optimization Strategies**

The website has been optimized for a better user experience by implementing several performance-enhancing techniques:

1. **Lazy Loading**: All images are lazy-loaded to reduce the initial load time.
2. **Defer JavaScript**: Non-critical JavaScript files are loaded asynchronously to prevent render-blocking.
3. **Minified Assets**: CSS and JavaScript files are minified to reduce file sizes.
4. **Preloading Key Resources**: Fonts and critical CSS are preloaded to ensure quick rendering of the content.
5. **Responsive Design**: TailwindCSS ensures that the website is fully responsive across devices.
6. **Caching**: Cache headers are set up to ensure repeat visitors have faster loading times.

## **Future Improvements**

There are several improvements I plan to make in the future:

1. **Backend Integration**: Currently, the website uses static JSON files. I plan to integrate a backend system to dynamically fetch projects and experience from a CMS.
2. **Service Worker**: I aim to implement a service worker to improve performance and enable offline access.
3. **Animations**: I plan to add more subtle animations to enhance the overall user experience.
4. **Accessibility Improvements**: Further improve accessibility (ARIA roles, keyboard navigation, etc.).
5. **SEO Enhancements**: Improve metadata and on-page SEO to ensure higher search rankings.
